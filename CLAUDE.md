# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## MANDATORY WORKFLOW - FOLLOW EVERY SESSION

### 1. Start Every Session
- **TodoWrite**: Create todo list for complex/multi-step tasks (3+ steps or non-trivial tasks)
- **Memory Check**: Search memory for relevant prior knowledge using `mcp__memory__search_nodes`
- **Sub-Agent Selection**: Choose appropriate sub-agent(s) based on task type (see Sub-Agents section)

### 2. During Work
- **TodoWrite**: Update progress frequently - mark tasks in_progress and completed immediately
- **Memory Capture**: For any technical discoveries, solutions, or architectural insights, IMMEDIATELY document in memory using MCP tools

### 3. End Every Session
- **Memory Documentation**: MANDATORY - Create memory entities for:
  - Technical issues discovered and their solutions
  - Design decisions made or conventions established
  - Architectural insights about PyHelios systems
  - Integration patterns or debugging approaches
- **TodoWrite**: Mark final tasks as completed, clean up stale items
- **Verification**: Confirm all memory writes were successful

### 4. Memory Guidelines
**When to write memory (REQUIRED):**
- New technical problems discovered and solved
- Plugin integration insights or patterns
- Testing architecture discoveries (like ctypes contamination)
- Build system or configuration changes
- Performance insights or optimization approaches

**How to write memory:**
- Use `mcp__memory__create_entities` with specific entityType (technical_issue, solution, architecture, etc.)
- Create meaningful relations with `mcp__memory__create_relations`
- Write detailed observations that future sessions can reference

## Virtual Environment

For development, create a virtual environment using your preferred method (venv, conda, etc.):

```bash
# Using venv
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Unix/macOS
# or venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows

# Using conda
conda create -n pyhelios python=3.9
conda activate pyhelios
```

## Project Overview

PyHelios provides cross-platform Python bindings for the Helios plant simulation software, offering a high-level interface for 3D plant modeling and simulation. The library uses ctypes with dynamic platform detection to interface with native C++ libraries and plugins.

**Cross-Platform Support**: 
- **Windows**: Full native support with pre-built DLLs
- **macOS/Linux**: Native support via build-from-source
- **Development Mode**: Mock mode for development on any platform without native libraries

## Development Commands

### Installation
```bash
pip install -e .
```

### Building Native Libraries

PyHelios now supports flexible plugin selection for customized builds based on your hardware and use case requirements.

#### Clean Helios-Style Project Structure

Following standard Helios C++ project conventions:
- **pyhelios_build/** - Source files (CMakeLists.txt, main.cpp, etc.)
- **pyhelios_build/build/** - All generated build artifacts including shared libraries for Python import

#### Plugin Selection Options

```bash
# Clean build from fresh state (recommended for troubleshooting)
build_scripts/build_helios --clean --plugins visualizer

# Basic builds
build_scripts/build_helios                           # Default build (non-GPU, non-vis plugins)
build_scripts/build_helios --nogpu                   # Exclude GPU plugins
build_scripts/build_helios --novis                   # Exclude visualization plugins

# Explicit plugin selection
build_scripts/build_helios --plugins weberpenntree,canopygenerator,visualizer

# Interactive selection
build_scripts/build_helios --interactive

# Exclude specific plugins
build_scripts/build_helios --exclude radiation

# Build with custom options
build_scripts/build_helios --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug --verbose

# Debug builds
build_scripts/build_helios --clean --plugins visualizer --buildmode debug
```

#### Plugin Discovery and Status

```bash
# Check plugin status and availability
python -m pyhelios.plugins status

# Discover optimal configuration for your system
python -m pyhelios.plugins discover

# Get information about specific plugins
python -m pyhelios.plugins info radiation

# Validate plugin configuration
python -m pyhelios.plugins validate --plugins radiation,visualizer

```

#### Configuration File Support

Create `pyhelios_config.yaml` to specify default plugin selection:

```yaml
plugins:
  explicit_plugins:
    - weberpenntree
    - visualizer
  excluded_plugins:
    - radiation  # Exclude if no GPU available

build:
  build_type: "Release"
  verbose: false
```

### Running Examples
```bash
python docs/examples/context_sample.py
python docs/examples/wpt_sample.py
python docs/examples/visualization_sample.py
```

### Platform Status
```bash
# Check current platform and library status
python -c "from pyhelios.plugins import print_plugin_status; print_plugin_status()"
```

## Style
- Don't add comments that are specific to a given debugging session. For example: "We don't need this anymore, reverting back to old behavior", "Remove Phase 2 code for Phase 3", etc. These types of comments don't make sense outside of a given session.

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components

- **Context** (`pyhelios/Context.py`): Central simulation environment that manages 3D primitives (patches, triangles, voxels). Provides methods for adding geometry, querying properties, and managing object collections.

- **WeberPennTree** (`pyhelios/WeberPennTree.py`): Plant modeling plugin for generating procedural trees. Supports multiple tree types (ALMOND, APPLE, AVOCADO, LEMON, OLIVE, etc.) with configurable parameters for branch recursion, segment resolution, and leaf subdivisions.

- **DataTypes** (`pyhelios/wrappers/DataTypes.py`): Core geometric data structures using ctypes for C++ interop:
  - vec2/vec3/vec4: Vector types for positions, sizes, directions
  - RGBcolor/RGBAcolor: Color representations  
  - SphericalCoord: Spherical coordinate system
  - int2/int3/int4: Integer vector types

### Flexible Plugin System

### Cross-Platform Library Loading

PyHelios includes a sophisticated cross-platform library loader (`pyhelios/plugins/loader.py`):

**Platform Support:**
- **Windows**: Uses `ctypes.WinDLL` with `.dll` files
- **macOS**: Uses `ctypes.CDLL` with `.dylib` files  
- **Linux**: Uses `ctypes.CDLL` with `.so` files

**Dynamic Loading Features:**
- Automatic platform detection and appropriate ctypes loader selection
- Fallback to mock mode when native libraries are unavailable
- Comprehensive error handling and informative error messages
- Library validation to ensure core functions are available
- **Runtime plugin detection**: Automatically detects which plugins are compiled into the library
- **Plugin capability discovery**: Provides detailed information about available plugin features
- Dependency checking for optional components (e.g., OptiX for GPU acceleration)
- **Graceful degradation**: Clear error messages when plugins are unavailable with actionable solutions

**Mock Mode:**
- Provides full API compatibility without requiring native libraries
- Enables development and testing on any platform
- Raises informative `RuntimeError` with clear instructions when mock functions are called
- Seamlessly integrates with the testing framework

### High-Level Plugin-Aware Classes

PyHelios provides high-level classes with automatic plugin detection and graceful error handling:

- **Context** (`pyhelios/Context.py`): Enhanced with plugin status reporting and availability checking
- **WeberPennTree** (`pyhelios/WeberPennTree.py`): Automatically detects weberpenntree plugin availability  
- **RadiationModel** (`pyhelios/RadiationModel.py`): High-level interface for radiation modeling with comprehensive error handling and alternative suggestions

### Plugin Registry and Management

- **PluginRegistry** (`pyhelios/plugins/registry.py`): Centralized plugin management with decorators for graceful fallbacks
- **Plugin Detection** (`pyhelios/plugins/loader.py`): Runtime detection of available plugin capabilities
- **Configuration Management** (`pyhelios/config/config_manager.py`): YAML-based configuration with validation

### Wrapper Layer

The `pyhelios/wrappers/` directory contains ctypes wrappers that interface with native plugins:
- `UContextWrapper`: Context operations
- `UWeberPennTreeWrapper`: Tree generation  
- `URadiationModelWrapper`: Radiation modeling (with availability detection)
- `UGlobalWrapper`: Global configuration
- `ULoggerWrapper`: Logging functionality

## Key Usage Patterns

### Basic Geometry Creation
```python
from pyhelios import Context
from pyhelios.types import *  # Convenient import for all vector types

context = Context()
center = vec3(2, 3, 4)
size = vec2(1, 1)
color = RGBcolor(0.25, 0.25, 0.25)
patch_uuid = context.addPatch(center=center, size=size, color=color)
```

### Vector Type Import Options

PyHelios provides two ways to import vector types:

**Option 1: Direct imports (recommended)**
```python
from pyhelios.types import *  # All vector types: vec3, RGBcolor, etc.
position = vec3(1, 2, 3)
color = RGBcolor(0.5, 0.5, 0.5)
```

**Option 2: Explicit DataTypes module**
```python
from pyhelios import DataTypes
position = DataTypes.vec3(1, 2, 3)
color = DataTypes.RGBcolor(0.5, 0.5, 0.5)
```

The star import (`from pyhelios.types import *`) includes all vector types: `vec2`, `vec3`, `vec4`, `int2`, `int3`, `int4`, `RGBcolor`, `RGBAcolor`, `SphericalCoord`, and factory functions like `make_vec3`.

### Tree Generation
```python
from pyhelios import Context, WeberPennTree, WPTType

context = Context()
wpt = WeberPennTree(context)
tree_id = wpt.buildTree(WPTType.LEMON)
```

#### Radiation Modeling with Graceful Handling
```python
from pyhelios import Context, RadiationModel

context = Context()

# RadiationModel automatically checks plugin availability
with RadiationModel(context) as radiation:
    radiation.add_radiation_band("SW")
    radiation.add_collimated_radiation_source()
    radiation.run_band("SW")
    results = radiation.get_total_absorbed_flux()
```

#### Plugin System Discovery
```python
from pyhelios.plugins.registry import get_plugin_registry

registry = get_plugin_registry()

# Get plugin capabilities
capabilities = registry.get_plugin_capabilities()
for plugin, info in capabilities.items():
    print(f"{plugin}: {info['description']}")
    if info['gpu_required']:
        print("  Requires GPU support")

# Check for missing plugins
missing = registry.get_missing_plugins(['radiation', 'visualizer'])
if missing:
    print(f"Missing plugins: {missing}")
```

### Context Managers
Both Context and WeberPennTree support context manager protocol for proper resource cleanup.

## Helios Core Integration

PyHelios interfaces with the main Helios C++ library located in `helios-core/`. The core Helios library provides:

### Core Architecture (`helios-core/core/`)
- **Context.h/cpp**: Central 3D simulation environment with primitive management
- **Global.h/cpp**: Global configuration and utility functions  
- **Vector types**: Comprehensive 3D vector math operations

### Plugin System (`helios-core/plugins/`)
Key plugins that PyHelios may interface with:
- **weberpenntree/**: Procedural tree generation using Weber-Penn algorithms
- **canopygenerator/**: Plant canopy generation for various species  
- **radiation/**: OptiX-accelerated ray tracing for radiation modeling
- **plantarchitecture/**: Advanced plant structure modeling
- **visualizer/**: OpenGL-based 3D visualization

### Test Development Guidelines

**Cross-Platform Testing:**
- **Cross-platform tests** work on all platforms using mock mode when needed
- **Native tests** require platform-specific native libraries 
- Use `@pytest.mark.cross_platform` for tests that work everywhere
- Use `@pytest.mark.native_only` for tests requiring native functionality
- All tests gracefully handle missing libraries with informative skip messages

**Mock Mode Development:**
- Mock mode tests validate API compatibility without requiring native libraries
- Mock mode allows development and testing on any platform without building native libraries
- Tests automatically skip when native libraries are unavailable with informative messages

**Test Configuration:**
- `pytest.ini` configures test markers and excludes `helios-core/` from test collection
- `conftest.py` provides shared fixtures and platform detection utilities
- Floating-point comparisons use `pytest.approx()` for cross-platform reliability

**Test Execution:**
- All tests run successfully on any platform - failing tests are automatically fixed
- Tests provide clear output showing passed/skipped/failed counts  
- Zero warnings and errors in final test execution

**CRITICAL: Mandatory Full Verification Protocol**
For ANY changes to C++ interface files (native/src/*, native/include/*, pyhelios_build/*), ctypes wrappers, or core functionality, you MUST complete this verification sequence:

1. **Full Native Rebuild**: Run `build_scripts/build_helios --clean` to rebuild from scratch
2. **Complete Test Suite**: Run `pytest` (uses subprocess isolation for robust testing) to verify ALL tests pass
3. **Zero Tolerance**: Any failing tests must be fixed before declaring success
4. **No Shortcuts**: Never skip the full test suite even if "individual tests pass"

This protocol is NON-NEGOTIABLE and must be completed regardless of time constraints or apparent simplicity of changes.

**Note**: PyHelios uses pytest-forked for subprocess isolation, preventing ctypes contamination and ensuring reliable test results across all test execution patterns.

**GitHub CI/CD Integration:**
- Comprehensive CI/CD workflows test PyHelios across all platforms
- Quick tests (`test-quick.yml`) for fast development feedback
- Matrix tests (`test-matrix.yml`) for comprehensive cross-platform validation
- Native library tests (`test-native.yml`) attempt to build and test with actual Helios libraries
- All workflows handle mock mode gracefully and provide meaningful test results

## Development Notes

**Cross-Platform Development:**
- **Full platform support**: PyHelios works seamlessly on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Mock mode**: Enables development and testing without native libraries on any platform  
- **Native libraries**: Build using `python build_scripts/build_helios.py` for full functionality
- **Platform detection**: Use `from pyhelios.plugins import get_plugin_info` to check current status and library availability

**Testing and Development Workflow:**
- **Comprehensive test suite**: 477 passing tests, 70 properly skipped, zero failures/errors/warnings
- **Subprocess isolation**: pytest-forked prevents ctypes contamination and state interference between tests
- **Cross-platform testing**: Run `pytest` on any platform - tests automatically adapt to available libraries
- **Mock mode development**: Develop and test PyHelios functionality without requiring native library compilation
- **Test categories**: Use `pytest -m cross_platform` for platform-independent tests, `pytest -m native_only` for native library tests
- **Robust test execution**: Tests pass consistently whether run individually or as part of full suite

**MANDATORY: Final Verification Checklist**
Before declaring ANY task complete involving C++/Python interface changes:
□ Built native libraries from scratch using `build_scripts/build_helios --clean`
□ Ran complete `pytest` suite (automatically uses subprocess isolation)
□ All tests pass with zero failures
□ No regressions introduced in any module  
□ Test session shows "plugins: forked-X.X.X" confirming subprocess isolation is active
□ Changes committed to git if task involves file modifications

Failure to complete this checklist constitutes incomplete task execution.

**Architecture and Integration:**
- **UUID-based tracking**: All geometric operations return UUIDs for object tracking
- **Context state management**: The Context manages geometry state with dirty/clean marking
- **Tree generation**: Allows customization of branch recursion levels, segment resolution, and leaf subdivisions
- **Native pointer access**: Available via `get_native_ptr()` methods for advanced operations
- **Helios core integration**: When debugging PyHelios issues, check corresponding C++ implementation in `helios-core/`

**Build and Configuration:**
- **Dynamic library loading**: Automatic platform detection and library loading with fallback to mock mode
- **Build system**: Use build scripts in `build_scripts/` to compile native libraries for your platform
- **Test configuration**: `pytest.ini` and `conftest.py` provide comprehensive test configuration
- **Error handling**: Informative error messages guide users when native libraries are unavailable

**Continuous Integration:**
- **GitHub Actions**: Comprehensive CI/CD workflows in `.github/workflows/`
- **Multi-platform testing**: Automated testing on Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS
- **Python version matrix**: Tests across Python 3.8-3.12
- **Mock mode validation**: All platforms test PyHelios functionality without native dependencies
- **Native library testing**: Best-effort compilation and testing with actual Helios libraries
- **Quick feedback**: Fast workflows for development branches provide rapid feedback

## Error Handling and Fallback Policy

**CRITICAL: PyHelios follows a fail-fast philosophy - never implement silent fallbacks that hide issues from users.** NEVER return fake values (0.0, empty lists, fake IDs), silently catch and ignore exceptions, or continue with misleading fallback functionality when core features fail. Instead, always raise explicit `RuntimeError` or `NotImplementedError` exceptions with clear, actionable error messages that explain what failed, why it failed, and how to fix it. The only acceptable fallbacks are explicit opt-in development modes, documented graceful degradation where users are informed, and safe no-ops like cleaning up `None` resources. **The Golden Rule: If something doesn't work, make it obvious** - users should never wonder why they got unexpected results, but should immediately see clear error messages with specific system requirements and actionable solutions.

## Plugin Integration Guidelines

### When Working on Plugin Integration

PyHelios has successfully integrated 3 major Helios C++ plugins (radiation, visualizer, WeberPennTree) through a sophisticated 8-phase integration process. When working on plugin integration tasks:

#### Use the Right Sub-Agent

- **For complete plugin integration projects**: Use `context-gatherer` to understand existing patterns, then `code-architect` for planning the integration
- **For C++ interface and build issues**: Use `helios-cpp-expert` for deep Helios core knowledge and CMake expertise  
- **For Python wrapper creation**: Use `code-reviewer` to ensure ctypes patterns follow best practices
- **For comprehensive testing**: Use `test-coverage-maximizer` to create robust cross-platform tests
- **For debugging integration issues**: Use `debug-specialist` for systematic troubleshooting

#### Critical Integration Requirements

**ALWAYS follow the 8-phase integration process:**

1. **Plugin Metadata Registration** - Add to `pyhelios/config/plugin_metadata.py`
2. **Build System Integration** - CMake and flexible plugin selection system
3. **C++ Interface Implementation** - Add wrapper functions to `pyhelios_build/pyhelios_interface.cpp`
4. **ctypes Wrapper Creation** - Python-to-C++ interface in `pyhelios/wrappers/`
5. **High-Level Python API** - User-friendly classes with context managers and error handling
6. **Asset Management** - Copy runtime assets (shaders, textures, configs) to expected locations
7. **Testing Integration** - Cross-platform tests with proper pytest markers
8. **Documentation** - API docs and usage examples

#### Essential Integration Patterns

**Asset Management (Critical)**:
Many plugins require runtime assets that must be copied to specific locations where C++ code expects them. ALWAYS check for and implement asset copying in the build system.

**Exception Handling (Mandatory)**:
- All C++ interface functions MUST use try/catch blocks with proper error codes
- Use errcheck callbacks for automatic exception translation
- Never allow C++ exceptions to cross into Python

**Plugin Availability Detection**:
- Check function availability using try/except around ctypes prototypes
- Provide actionable error messages with rebuild instructions
- Implement mock mode for development when plugins unavailable

**Parameter Mapping Precision**:
- Check actual C++ constructor signatures - don't assume parameter order or meaning
- Map parameters semantically, not just positionally
- Test different parameter combinations

**Git Control**:
- Be sure to add any files to git control that will be needed in the repository.

#### Documentation Requirements

For plugin integration tasks, ALWAYS:
- Reference the comprehensive [Plugin Integration Guide](docs/plugin_integration_guide.md) for step-by-step workflow
- Use the [C++ Plugin Integration Guide](docs/cpp_plugin_integration_guide.md) for technical C++ interface details
- Document all new plugin APIs with examples and error handling guidance
- Include troubleshooting sections for common integration issues

#### Testing Requirements

All plugin integrations MUST include:
- **Cross-platform tests** (`@pytest.mark.cross_platform`) that work with mock mode
- **Native-only tests** (`@pytest.mark.native_only`) that require actual plugin functionality
- **Plugin metadata tests** to verify registration
- **Error handling tests** to verify proper exception translation
- **Asset management tests** to verify runtime dependencies are available

#### Build System Requirements

When integrating plugins:
- Use the flexible plugin selection system - no manual CMake modifications needed for basic plugins
- Implement asset copying for runtime dependencies (shaders, textures, fonts, configs)
- Test build system with `--clean` builds and different plugin combinations
- Verify cross-platform symbol export and library loading
- Validate that built libraries can be loaded by ctypes on all platforms

#### Quality Standards

Maintain PyHelios's high standards:
- **Fail-fast error handling** - never silent fallbacks or fake return values
- **Cross-platform compatibility** - test on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Comprehensive documentation** - include examples, error scenarios, and troubleshooting
- **Robust testing** - cover both mock mode and native library scenarios
- **Performance considerations** - document any performance characteristics or limitations

#### Critical Lessons from Compound Geometry Integration

**Memory Management**: Always implement safe context cleanup to prevent segmentation faults:
```python
def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
    if self.context is not None:
        context_wrapper.destroyContext(self.context)
        self.context = None  # Prevent double deletion - CRITICAL
```

**ctypes Type Equality**: Never rely on `==` for ctypes structures - use field comparison:
```python
# WRONG: color != RGBcolor(1, 1, 1) may fail even when values are equal
# RIGHT: field-based comparison  
if color and not (color.r == 1.0 and color.g == 1.0 and color.b == 1.0):
```

**Parameter Array Mapping**: Check actual array sizes returned by ctypes structures:
```python
# SphericalCoord.to_list() returns 4 elements [radius, elevation, zenith, azimuth]
# But C++ interface expects 3 elements [radius, elevation, azimuth] 
rotation_list = [rotation.radius, rotation.elevation, rotation.azimuth]
```

**Vector Pre-allocation**: Always pre-allocate vectors in C++ for efficiency:
```cpp
std::vector<helios::vec3> nodes_vec;
nodes_vec.reserve(node_count);  // Pre-allocate - CRITICAL for performance
```

**Thread-Local Static Vectors**: Use thread_local for static return vectors:
```cpp
static thread_local std::vector<unsigned int> static_result;  // Not just static
```

## MCP: Knowledge-graph memory policy

- Server alias: `memory` (added via `claude mcp add memory npx:@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory`).
- Purpose: persist structured facts and relationships about this repo, projects, and collaborators using the knowledge-graph memory tools.
- Safety: summarize what you plan to store before writing; do not store secrets or API keys.

### When to write memory
Trigger a write when any of the following occur:
1. A new project, module, or dataset is introduced.
2. A design decision or convention is finalized.
3. A collaborator’s role, preference, or responsibility is clarified.

### How to write memory
Use the server’s tools rather than free-form text. Prefer the smallest useful graph entries.

1. Create entities  
Run the MCP tool `create_entities` with fields `name`, `entityType`, and `observations`. Example:
- “Create an entity for the library ‘Helios EnergyBalanceModel’ with observation summarizing the inputs, outputs, and key files.”

2. Add relations  
Run `create_relations` to connect entities. Example:
- “Link ‘Helios EnergyBalanceModel’ to ‘SurfaceEnergyBalance’ with relationType ‘implements’.”

3. Update or annotate  
Use `append_observations` to add a brief dated note when behavior or conventions change.

### When to read memory
Before large refactors, onboarding explanations, or when the task mentions prior decisions, call `search_entities` or `search_relations` with a concise query, then cite what you found.

### Usage examples
- “Search memory for entities about ‘Helios’ and ‘stomatal conductance’ and summarize relevant observations.”
- “Create entities for ‘GEMINI project’ (type: project) and ‘Nonpareil orchard dataset’ (type: dataset), then relate them with relationType ‘uses’.”

### References inside prompts
- To reference MCP resources or trigger tools, you can type `/mcp` in Claude Code to view available servers and tools, or mention the server by name in your instruction, e.g., “Using the `memory` server, run `search_entities` for ‘trellis’.” See Anthropic’s MCP guide for listing and managing servers.
